### Hi, welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 22 year old student from ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª who wants to work with computer games.

#### About me
* Currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science studies at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden.
* Started with coding as a hobby back when I was around 13 because I wanted to make diamonds out of dirt on my friends Minecraft server.
* Sometimes I actually develop real Minecraft mods, check them out here: https://www.curseforge.com/members/br4nder5/projects, or here on my git
